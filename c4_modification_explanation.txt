Explanation of Changes
1. Lexical Analysis (next()):
added a condition to recognize the % character as the Mod token. This allows the lexer to correctly identify modulus operators in the source code.
2. Expression Parsing (expr()):
added a case to handle the Mod token during expression parsing.
When a modulus operator is encountered, we emit the following virtual machine instructions:
PSH: Push the left operand onto the stack.
expr(Inc): Recursively parse the right operand.
MOD: Emit the MOD instruction, which will perform the modulus operation.
3. Virtual Machine (main()):
added a case to handle the MOD opcode during virtual machine execution.
When the MOD opcode is encountered, we:
Pop the left operand from the stack.
Perform the modulus operation (a = *sp++ % a).
Store the result in the a register.
. How Changes Affect Compiler Behavior

New Operator Support:
The compiler now supports the modulus operator (%) in C4 source code.
This allows programmers to perform remainder calculations.
Virtual Machine Execution:
The virtual machine can now execute the MOD instruction, which performs the modulus operation.
For Example:
Now we can use code like: int a = 10 % 3; in the C4 code.
